Okay, this is my turn-based rogue-like game with deep level of loneliness and mental problems.
I were thinking about posting on Heroku, but there are some problems with loading Quintus engine.
Hence the CDN Quintus is okay with file:// urls i will continue my work only with local drive and github for now
